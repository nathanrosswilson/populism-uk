# populism-uk
This repository is for the code relating to my analysis of changing populist rhetoric in the UK Parliament.

My hypothesis was that populist rhetoric has increased in recent years. I would test this by looking at two different aspects of populist communication, simple language and populist words. Based on previous reserach I translated those metrics into Flesch readibility and percent of populist words that has been verified in previously published work.


1. main.py is the scrapper that I used to gather the data from the Hansard Database
2. Flesch.py is how I calculated the Flesch Readability score
3. populism.py is how I measured the percent of populist words in the speeches
2. analysis.py is the statistical analysis of the organized speech data

The results of the analysis found no appreciable increase in populist rhetoric in the UK Parliament from 2006 to 2020.
